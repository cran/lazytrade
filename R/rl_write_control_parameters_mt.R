#' Function to find and write the best control parameters.
#'
#' @description This function is supposed to run on a weekly basis. Purpose of this function is to perform RL and
#' trading simulation and find out the best possible control parameters for the RL function.
#'
#' @param x - dataset containing the trading results for one trading robot
#' @param path_control_files - path where control parameters will be saved
#'
#' @details Function is used by the R script Adapt_RL_MT_control.R
#'
#' @return Function writes best control parameters to be used by the Reinforcement Learning Function

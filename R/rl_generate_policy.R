#' Function performs Reinforcement Learning using the past data to generate model policy
#'
#' @description  This function will perform Reinforcement Learning using Trading Data.
#' It will suggest whether or not it is better to keep using trading systems or not.
#' Function is just using results of the past performance to generate the recommendation (not a holy grail).
#'
#' @details Initial policy is generated using a dummy zero values.
#' This way function starts working directly from the first observation.
#' However policy 'ON' value will only be generated once the Q value is greater than zero
#'
#' @param x - Dataframe containing trading data
#' @param states - Character vector, Selected states of the System
#' @param actions - Character vector, Selected actions executed under environment
#' @param control - List, control parameters as defined in the Reinforcement Learning Package
#'
#' @return Function returns data frame with reinforcement learning model policy
#' @export

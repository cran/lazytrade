#' Function used to evaluate market type situation by reading the file with Macroeconomic Events
#' and writing a trigger to the trading robot
#'
#' @description Function is reading the content of the file 01_MacroeconomicEvent.csv.
#' Content of the file can be either 1 or 0.
#' 1 - when Macro Economic event is present, 0 - when it's not.
#' Function will also read magic number of the trading robots. This is indicated in the file 'Setup.csv'.
#' Final outcome of the function is the series of files written to the destination directories.
#' These files will either enable or disable opening of new positions in the trading robots
#'#'
#'
#' @details This function is used exclusively with Market Type recognition system.
#'
#' Final evaluation will consist in writing a dedicated file with a simple information:
#'
#' When Macro economic even is not present:
#'
#' "Magic","IsEnabled"
#' 8139125,1
#'
#' or, when Macro economic event is present:
#'
#' "Magic","IsEnabled"
#' 8139125,0
#'
#' @param path_T1 Path of the Terminal 1
#' @param path_T3 Path of the Terminal 3
#' @param setup_file_path string, path to the folder with Setup.csv file
#' @param setup_file_name string, name of the file 'Setup.csv'
#' @param macro_event_path string, path to the folder with a file '01_MacroeconomicEvent.csv'
#' @param macro_file_name string, name of the file '01_MacroeconomicEvent.csv'
#'
#' @return Function will write files indicating to enable or disable trading systems to open new orders

#' Function used to evaluate market type situation by reading the file with Macroeconomic Events
#'
#' @description Function is reading the content of the file 01_MacroeconomicEvent.csv.
#' Should the content of the file is 1 then Macro Economic event is present,
#' all trading robots will not be able to open new orders
#'
#' @details This function is used exclusively with Market Type recognition system
#'
#' @param setup_path Path with trading robots magic numbers setup, typically file 'Setup.csv'
#' @param file_name Name of the file
#' @param path_t1 Path of the Terminal 1
#' @param path_t3 Path of the Terminal 3
#'
#' @return Function will write files indicating to enable or disable trading systems to open new orders
#' @export
